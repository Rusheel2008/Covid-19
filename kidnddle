Coronavirus, any virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. 
Coronaviruses have enveloped virions (virus particles) that measure approximately 120 nm (1 nm = 10âˆ’9 metre) in diameter. Club-shaped glycoprotein spikes in the envelope 
give the viruses a crownlike, or coronal, appearance. The nucleocapsid, made up of a protein shell known as a capsid and containing the viral nucleic acids, is helical or 
tubular. The coronavirus genome consists of a single strand of positive-sense RNA (ribonucleic acid).
